- Goal, remove Address and use Cell
  - [X] Cell constructor should take x and y
    - [X] Cell should x and y properties instead of the `address` field/property
      - [X] `areNeighborsInUniverse` should take resident 
      - [X] `areNeighborsInUniverse` should not take a residentAddress
        - [X] population should take resident
  - [X] Cell constructor should not take `Address`

- Goal, move `count()` to `Universe`
  - [ ] remove `Neigbhors` class
    - [X] Universe should not take `Neighbors` in constructor
    - [X] should be removed from all tests
  - [ ] Cell should return `neigborsPositions`
    - [ ] `count()` in Universe should take the `neighborsPositions`
  - [ ] `count()` should not take `population`
  - [ ] `count()` should be called `countLiveNeighborsOf()`
    - [ ] `countLiveNeighborsOf()` should take a Cell
  - [ ] `areNeighborsInUniverse` should live in the Universe
